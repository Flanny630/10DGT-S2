# Write a program to calculate the cost of fencing for a rectangular area.  
# You can assume that all units are in meters. 
# You need to ask the user for the length and width of the area to be fenced.  
# You also need to ask for the cost of fencing per m.  
# Your program should then calculate the cost of fencing.  
# It should be possible to do more than one calculation at a time.â€‹
