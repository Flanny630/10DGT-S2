# Different types of variables
# Store a number
num_1 = 80 # assigning 80 to num_1
print(num_1) # This displays what num_1 contains

# Store a string
name= "Flanny"
print(name)
name= "Hey~" # reassinging value to an existing variable
print(name)
name_1= "XUe"
print (name_1)

# Do calculations in a variable and store the result
sum=5+5 # not good practice
sum = 5 + 5 # follows PEP8 Python conventions
print(sum) 
sum_string = "5 + 5 = 10" # this is a string
print(sum)

# Adding strings together is called concatenation
concatenation = name_1 + sum_string
print(concatenation)
